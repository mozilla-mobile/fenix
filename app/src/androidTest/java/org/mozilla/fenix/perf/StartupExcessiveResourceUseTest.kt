 * The number of times a StrictMode violation is suppressed during this start up scenario.
 * Incrementing the expected value indicates a potential performance regression.
 *
 * One feature of StrictMode is to detect potential performance regressions and, in particular, to
 * detect main thread IO. This includes network requests (which can block for multiple seconds),
 * file read/writes (which generally block for tens to hundreds of milliseconds), and file stats
 * (like most SharedPreferences accesses, which block for small amounts of time). Main thread IO
 * should be replaced with a background operation that posts to the main thread when the IO request
 * is complete.
 *
 * Say no to main thread IO! 🙅

 * The number of times we call the `runBlocking` coroutine method on the main thread during this

 * coroutine. While the main thread is blocked, 1) we can't handle user input and the user may feel
 * Firefox is slow and 2) we can't use the main thread to continue initialization that must occur on
 * the main thread (like initializing UI), slowing down start up overall. Blocking calls should
 * generally be replaced with a slow operation on a background thread launching onto the main thread
 * when completed. However, in a very small number of cases, blocking may be impossible to avoid.

 *
 * ConstraintLayout is expensive to inflate (though fast to measure/layout) so we want to avoid
 * creating too many of them synchronously during start up. Generally, these should be inflated
 * asynchronously or replaced with cheaper layouts (if they're not too expensive to measure/layout).

 * Each layout inflation is suspected of having overhead (e.g. accessing each layout resource from

/**
 * A performance test that attempts to minimize start up performance regressions using heuristics
 * rather than benchmarking. These heuristics measure occurrences of known performance anti-patterns
 * and fails when the occurrence count changes. If the change indicates a regression, we should
 * re-evaluate the PR to see if we can avoid the potential regression and, if not, change the
 * expected value. If it indicates an improvement, we can change the expected value. The expected
 * values can be updated without consulting the performance team.
 *
 * See `EXPECTED_*` above for explanations of the heuristics this test currently supports.
 *
 * The benefits of a heuristics-based performance test are that it is uses less CI time to get
 * results so we can run it more often (e.g. for each PR) and it is less noisy than a benchmark.
 * However, the downsides of this style of test is that if a heuristic value increases, it may not
 * represent a real, significant performance regression.
