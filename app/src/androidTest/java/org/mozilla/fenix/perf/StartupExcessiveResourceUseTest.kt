/**
 * A performance test to limit the number of StrictMode suppressions and number of runBlocking used
 * on startup.
 *
 * This test was written by the perf team.
 *
 * StrictMode detects main thread IO, which is often indicative of a performance issue.
 * It's easy to suppress StrictMode so we wrote a test to ensure we have a discussion
 * if the StrictMode count changes.
 *
 * RunBlocking is mostly used to return values to a thread from a coroutine. However, if that
 * coroutine takes too long, it can lead that thread to block every other operations.
 *
 * The perf team is code owners for this package so they should be notified when the counts are modified.
