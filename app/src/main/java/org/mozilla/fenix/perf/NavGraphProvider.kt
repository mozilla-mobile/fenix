/**
 * This class asynchronously loads the navigation graph XML. This is a performance optimization:
 * large nav graphs take ~29ms to inflate on the Moto G5 (#16900). This also seemingly prevents the
 * HomeFragment layout XML from being unnecessarily inflated when it isn't used, improving perf by
 * ~148ms on the Moto G5 for VIEW start up (#18245) though it was unintentional and we may wish to
 * implement more intentional for that.
 *
 * The general flow of this object is:
 *
 * Right after HomeActivity contentView inflation
 *     Start inflation on IO
 * If navGraph is needed
 *     block on Main Thread until inflation completes
 *     setNavGraph on MainThread
 * Else
 *     setNavGraph on MainThread when ready (default case)
 *
 * This class is defined as an Object, rather than as a class instance in our Components, because
 * it needs to be called by the [NavController] extension function which can't easily access Components.
 *
 * To use this class properly, [inflateNavGraphAsync] must be called first before
 * [blockForNavGraphInflation] using the same [NavController] instance.
