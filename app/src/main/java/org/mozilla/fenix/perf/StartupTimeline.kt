/**
 * A collection of functionality to instrument, measure, and understand startup performance. The
 * responsibilities of this class are to update the internal [StartupState] based on the methods
 * called and to delegate calls to its dependencies, which handle other functionality related to
 * understanding startup.
 *
 * This class, and its dependencies, may need to be modified for any changes in startup.
 *
 * This class is not thread safe and should only be called from the main thread.
 *
 * [onApplicationInit] is called from multiple processes. To minimize overhead, the class
 * dependencies are lazily initialized.
