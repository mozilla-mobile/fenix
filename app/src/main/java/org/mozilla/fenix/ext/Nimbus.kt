 * This is a manual function to accomplish the same purpose as passing `true` as the

 * when requesting feature variables must occur at a different time than the actual user's
 * exposure to the feature within the app.
 *
 * - Examples:
 *     - If the `Variables` are needed at a different time than when the exposure to the feature
 *         actually happens, such as constructing a menu happening at a different time than the
 *         user seeing the menu.
 *     - If `getVariables` is required to be called multiple times for the same feature and it is
 *         desired to only record the exposure once, such as if `getVariables` were called
 *         with every keystroke.
 *
 * In the case where the use of this function is required, then the `getVariables` function
 * should be called with `false` so that the exposure event is not recorded when the variables
 * are fetched.
 *
 * This function is safe to call even when there is no active experiment for the feature. The SDK
 * will ensure that an event is only recorded for active experiments.
 *
 *  @param featureId string representing the id of the feature for which to record the exposure
 *     event.
