/**
 * A lazy initializer for FxaAccountManager if it isn't already initialized.
 *
 * Implementation notes: For push notifications, we need to initialize the service on
 * Application#onCreate as soon as possible in order to receive messages. These are then decrypted
 * and the observers of the push feature are notified.
 *
 * One of our observers is [FxaAccountManager] that needs to know about messages like Send Tab,
 * new account logins, etc. This however comes at the cost of having the account manager
 * initialized and observing the push feature when it initializes (which once again happens on
 * application create) - the total cost of startup time now is additive for the both of them.
 *
 * What this integration class aims to do, is to observe the push feature immediately in order to act
 * as a (temporary) delegate, and when we see a push message from FxA, only then we should
 * initialize and deliver the message.
 *
 * Once FxaAccountManager is initialized, we no longer need this integration as there already are
 * existing features to support these feature requirements, so we safely unregister ourselves.
 * See: [FxaPushSupportFeature] and [SendTabFeature].
 *
 * A solution that we considered was to pass in [BackgroundServices] to the [Push] class
 * and lazily invoke the account manager - that lead to a cyclic dependency of initialization since
 * [BackgroundServices] also depends on [Push] directly for observing messages via the account-based
 * features.
 *
 * Another solution was to create a message buffer to queue up the messages until the account could
 * consume them - this added the complexity of maintaining a buffer, the possibility of flooding the
 * buffer, and delaying the delivery of high importance messages like Send Tab which are required to
 * be processed immediately.
 *
 * Our final solution ended up being more concise that the above options that met all our required
 * assurances, and most importantly, maintainable.
