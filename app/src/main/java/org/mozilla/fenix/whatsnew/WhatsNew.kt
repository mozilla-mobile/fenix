/**
 * Helper class tracking whether the application was recently updated in order to show "What's new"
 * menu items and indicators in the application UI.
 *
 * The application is considered updated when the application's version name changes (versionName
 * in the manifest). The applications version code would be a good candidates too, but it might
 * change more often (RC builds) without the application actually changing from the user's point
 * of view.
 *
 * Whenever the application was updated we still consider the application to be "recently updated"
 * for the next few days.
