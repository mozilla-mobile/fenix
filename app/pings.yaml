activation:
  description: |
    This ping is intended to provide a measure of the activation of mobile
    products. It's generated when Fenix starts, right after Glean is
    initialized. It doesn't include the client_id, since it might be reporting
    an hashed version of the Google Advertising ID.

startup-timeline:

    This ping is intended to provide an understanding of startup performance.

    In addition to being captured on real devices, the ping data was prematurely
    optimized into this separate ping to be isolated from other metrics to be
    more easily captured by performance testing automation but that hasn't
    happened in practice. We would have removed it but implementation
    details don't make that possible:
