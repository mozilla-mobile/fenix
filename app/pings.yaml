    This ping is intended to provide a measure of the activation of mobile
    products. It's generated when Fenix starts, right after Glean is
    initialized. It doesn't include the client_id, since it might be reporting
    an hashed version of the Google Advertising ID.

    This ping is intended to provide an understanding of startup performance.

    The ping is intended to be captured by performance testing automation to
    report results there, in addition to user telemetry. We place these metrics
    into their own ping in order to isolate them and make this process easier.
