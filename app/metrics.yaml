  app_opened_all_startup:
    type: event
    description: |
      A user opened the app to the HomeActivity. The HomeActivity
      encompasses the home screen, browser screen, settings screen,
      collections and other screens in the nav_graph.
      This differs from the app_opened probe because it measures all
      startups, not just cold startup. Note: There is a short gap
      between the time application goes into background and the time
      android reports the application going into the background.
      Note: This metric does not record souce when app opened from
      task switcher: open application -> press home button -> open
      recent tasks -> choose fenix. In this case will report
      [source = unknown, type = hot, has_saved_instance_state = false].

        description: |
          the startup type for opening fenix. the application and HomeActivity
          either needs to be created or started again. possible values are
          `cold`, `warm`, `hot` or `error`. Error is for impossible cases.
          Please file a bug if you see the error case.
          app created AND HomeActivity created = cold
          app started AND HomeActivity created = warm
          app started AND HomeActivity started = hot
          app created AND HomeActivity started = error
          Some applications such as gmail launches the default browser in the
          background. So when we eventually click a link, browser is already
          started in the background. This means that custom_tab will mostly
          report `warm` startup type.
      source:
        description: |
          The method used to open Fenix. Possible values are `app_icon`,
          `custom_tab`, `link` or `unknown`. unknown is for startup sources
          where we can't pinpoint the cause. One UNKNOWN case is the app
          switcher where we don't know what variables to check to ensure this
          startup wasn't caused by something else.
      has_saved_instance_state:
        description: |
          boolean value whether or not startup type has a savedInstance.
          using savedInstance, HomeActivity's previous state can be restored.
          This is an optional key since it is not applicable to all the cases.
          for example, when we are doing a hot start up, we cant have a
          savedInstanceState therefore we report only [APP_ICON, HOT] instead
          of [APP_ICON, HOT, false].
      first_frame_pre_draw_nanos:
        description: |
          the number of nanoseconds the application took to launch. This is the
          time difference between application launch(user pressing app_icon,
          launching a link) and until the first view is about to be drawn
          on the screen. If the time is not captured, this extra key will
          not be reported.

  app_received_intent:
    type: event
    description: |
      The system received an Intent for the HomeActivity. An intent
      is received an external entity wants to the app to display
      content. Intents can be received when the app is closed – at
      which point the app will be opened – or when the app is
      already opened – at which point the already open app will make
      changes such as loading a url. This can be used loosely as a
      heuristic for when the user requested to open the app. The
      HomeActivity encompasses the home screen and browser screen but
      may include other screens. This differs from the app_opened
      probe because it measures all startups, not just cold startup.

      Threshold for "recency" set in HomeActivity#PWA_RECENTLY_USED_THRESHOLD.
      Currently we are not told by the OS when a PWA is removed by the user,
      so we use the "recently used" heuristic to judge how many PWAs are still
      active, as a proxy for "installed". This value will only be set if the
      user has at least *one* recently used PWA. If they have 0, this metric
      will not be sent, resulting in a null value during analysis on the
      server-side. To disambiguate between a failed `recently_used_pwa_count`
      metric and 0 recent PWAs, please see `has_recent_pwas`.

      https://github.com/mozilla-mobile/fenix/issues/1607) the value will be

      `source` will be: `action`, `suggestion`, `widget`, `shortcut`, `topsite`
      (depending on the source from which the search started). Also added the
      `other` option for the source but it should never enter on this case.

      The duration the Android framework takes to start before letting us run
      code in `*Application.init` when this device has
      `clock_ticks_per_second_v2` equal to 100: if it's not equal to 100, then
      this value is captured in `framework_secondary`. We split this into two
      metrics to make it easier to analyze in GLAM. We split on 100 because
      when we did our initial brief analysis -
      https://sql.telemetry.mozilla.org/queries/75591 - the results for clocks
      ticks were overwhelmingly 100.

      The duration is calculated from `appInitTimestamp -
      processStartTimestamp`. `processStartTimestamp` is derived from the clock
      tick time unit, which is expected to be less granular than nanoseconds.
      Therefore, we convert and round our timestamps to clock ticks before
      computing the difference and convert back to nanoseconds to report.

      For debugging purposes, `clock_ticks_per_second_v2`, which may vary
      between devices, is also reported as a metric
