// This gradle scripts generates a "unique" version code for our release versions.
//
// The result of the version code depends on the timezone. We assume that this script will only be used
// for release versions and running on our build servers with a fixed timezone.
//
// The version code is composed like: yDDDHHmm
//  * y   = Double digit year, with 18 subtracted: 2018 -> 18 -> 0
//  * DDD = Day of the year, pad with zeros if needed: September 6th -> 249
//  * HH  = Hour in day (00-23)
//  * mm  = Minute in hour
//
// For September 6th, 2018, 9:41 am this will generate the versionCode: 2490941 (0-249-09-41).
//
// Note that we only use this generated version code for builds we want to distribute. For local
// debug builds we use a fixed versionCode to not mess with the caching mechanism of the build
// system.
