  ### Output Style flag
  ## Output style of execution status. May be one of [verbose, multi, single, compact].
  ## For runs with only one test execution the default value is 'verbose', in other cases
  ## 'multi' is used as the default. The output style 'multi' is not displayed correctly on consoles
  ## which don't support ansi codes, to avoid corrupted output use single or verbose.
  ## The output style `compact` is used to produce less detailed output, it prints just Args, test and matrix count, weblinks, cost, and result reports.
  output-style: compact
  ### Full Junit Result flag
  ## Enable create additional local junit result on local storage with failure nodes on passed flaky tests.
