## Start of sprint [Monday, 1st week of sprint]
- [ ] Create an issue in the *upcoming* milestone: "What's New Entry for [release]" to track work for the SUMO page and Google Play release notes.

## String freeze [Tuesday, 1st week of sprint]
- [ ] Make sure all issues with label "strings needed" have strings assigned and the label updated to "strings approved"
- [ ] Pre-land all strings for features that have not been implemented yet

## Soft code freeze [Wednesday, 2nd week of sprint]
- [ ] Create a branch for the *current* milestone and protect it through Settings on the repo (need admin privileges). After that master is tracking the next milestone.
- [ ] On the Release branch, pin the AC version to the stable version (like https://github.com/mozilla-mobile/fenix/commit/e413da29f6a7a7d4a765817a9cd5687abbf27619 ) w/ commit message "Pin to stable AC `<version>` for release"
- [ ] [Create an issue](https://github.com/mozilla-mobile/fenix/issues/new?template=release_checklist.md&title=Releng+for+) in the *upcoming* milestone: "Releng for [release]".
- [ ] Go through the list of bugs closed during this sprint and make sure all they're all added to the correct milestone.
- [ ] Add either `eng:qa:needed` flags on each issue that still needs it.
- [ ] Make sure the "Final string Import" has already happened.

### SUMO Verification [Thursday, 2nd week of sprint]
- [ ] Verify with SUMO the contents of the whats new / other sumo pages are accurate with what is in this release.

### Product Integrity [Thursday, 2nd week of sprint]

- [ ] Tag first pre-release RC version in Github. For 1.0 the tag would be 1.0.0-rc.1. This will kick off a build of the branch. You can see it in the mouseover of the CI badge of the branch in the commits view.

    If you need to trigger a new RC build, you need to draft a publish a new (pre-release) release. Editing an existing release and creating a new tag will not trigger a new RC build.

- [ ] Upload the APK from the Taskcluster signing task to the [releases page](https://github.com/mozilla-mobile/fenix/releases).
- [ ] Create a new PI request in Jira. You can clone [this issue](https://jira.mozilla.com/browse/PI-219).

### During Product Integrity

- [ ] Check Google Play for new crashes. File issues and triage.
- [ ] If bugs are considered release blocker then fix them on master and the milestone branch (cherry-pick / uplift)
- [ ] If needed tag a new RC version (e.g. v1.0-RC2) and follow the submission checklist again.

## Release to Google Play Store [Tuesday, 3rd week]

- [ ] Tag the last and released RC version additionally with the tag of the release (v1.0-RC2 -> v1.0) (This can be done as soon as there are no more release blockers, does not need to be on Release Day.)
- [ ] Upload signed APKs to the [release page](https://github.com/mozilla-mobile/fenix/releases)
- [ ] Create a release request in Bugzilla. You can clone [this issue](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1571967) and NI someone from release management.

    Release management promotes the build from beta to the release channel. For minor releases this can happen at any time during the day. Major releases often need to be synchronized with other marketing activities (e.g. blog postings). Releases are rolled out to 99% of the population (otherwise the rollout can't be stopped).

## After the release

- [ ] Follow up with release management to set the rollout to 100%
- [ ] Check whether there are new crashes that need to be filed.
