### Dependencies (Added by PM and Eng)


### Acceptance Criteria (Added by PM)
- Event pings can be queried via re:dash
- We are sending telemetry events for the actions listed in the requirements
- We have documented the telemetry
- We have asked a data steward to [review](https://github.com/mozilla/data-review/blob/master/request.md) the telemetry
- NOT an AC: Data science to create dashboard or further graphs (this will be a separate issue, this issue is only about hooking up the events described and that they can be queried in re-dash)
