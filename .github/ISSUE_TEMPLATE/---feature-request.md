[comment]: # (Please do your best to search for duplicate issues before filing a new issue so we can keep our issue board clean)
[comment]: # (Every issue should have exactly one feature request described in it. Please do not file feedback list tickets as it is difficult to parse them and address their individual points)
[comment]: # (Feature Requests are better when they’re open-ended instead of demanding a specific solution e.g: “I want an easier way to do X” instead of “add Y”)
