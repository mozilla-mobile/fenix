## Build Instructions


1. Clone or Download the repository:

  ```shell
  git clone https://github.com/mozilla-mobile/fenix
  ```

2. Import the project into Android Studio **or** build on the command line:

  ```shell
  ./gradlew clean app:assembleArmDebug
  ```

3. Make sure to select the correct build variant in Android Studio:
**armDebug** for ARM
**x86Debug** for X86

## Pre-push hooks
To reduce review turn-around time, we'd like all pushes to run tests locally. We'd
recommend you use our provided pre-push hook in `config/pre-push-recommended.sh`.
Using this hook will guarantee your hook gets updated as the repository changes.
This hook tries to run as much as possible without taking too much time.

To add it on Mac/Linux, run this command from the project root:
```sh
ln -s ../../config/pre-push-recommended.sh .git/hooks/pre-push
```
or for Windows run this command with administrative privileges:
```sh
mklink .git\hooks\pre-push ..\..\config\pre-push-recommended.sh
```

To push without running the pre-push hook (e.g. doc updates):
```sh
git push <remote> --no-verify
```
